## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm [Hanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huzavahanna/), Welcome to my github!

 I am delighted to share that I have completed the full-stack development program in MigraCode, and I am also a certified Frontend Developer with the Rolling Scopes School. 

 I am a career switcher about tech robust problem-solving skills.

 I am currently living in Barcelona, Spain, and have a valid work permit in Spain. 

 I am looking for a suitable environment to put my skills to use in a way that benefits both parties.
